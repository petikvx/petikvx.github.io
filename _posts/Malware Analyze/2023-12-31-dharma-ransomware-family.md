# Dharma Ransomware family

## History

Dharma, also known as Crysis, is a type of ransomware, a malicious software that encrypts files on a computer or a computer network and then demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key to restore the files. Here are some important features of the Dharma ransomware:

1.  Initial Discovery: Dharma ransomware was initially discovered around October 21, 2017. Originally, it was known as Crysis before taking on the name Dharma.
    
2.  Encryption Method: Dharma encrypts all files on an infected computer, making these files inaccessible without the appropriate decryption key. It uses a strong encryption algorithm to lock the data.
    
3.  Ransom Demand: Once files are encrypted, attackers demand a ransom payment in Bitcoin from the victims to provide the decryption key. Victims are typically presented with a ransom demand displayed on their computer screen.
    
4.  Variants: There are many variants of Dharma, each with its own specific file extensions used to mark the encrypted files. For example, some variants use file extensions such as .BMP, .BIP, .COMBO, etc.
    
5.  Propagation Methods: Dharma primarily spreads through open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports, exploiting various vulnerabilities or using dictionary or brute force attacks to gain access to systems. Once access is obtained, attackers can spread laterally within the network using tools like Mimikatz to gain administrative control over other machines.
    
6.  Activity Monitoring: The cybercriminals behind Dharma typically monitor the activities of the targeted business to assess the value of the encrypted data and adjust their strategy accordingly.
    

In summary, Dharma is a dangerous ransomware that targets computer systems, encrypts victims' files, and demands a Bitcoin ransom to restore access to the data. It primarily spreads through RDP security flaws and can have numerous variants. Businesses should take measures to protect themselves against this type of threat by strengthening their computer security and regularly backing up their data.

## API call

With IDA, you can see that few Windows APIs are used.

![api-call](/images/dharma/dharma-02.png)

The studied ransomware does not directly call APIs but instead utilizes `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` functions to dynamically retrieve function addresses from dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). This approach provides increased flexibility by dynamically loading libraries, checking for the existence of functions, and handling errors gracefully, facilitating interoperability and version management of the libraries used by the ransomware.

```cpp
HMODULE __cdecl sub_4065E0(const CHAR *a1)
{
  HMODULE result; // eax
  const CHAR *lpLibFileName; // [esp+0h] [ebp-Ch]
  LPCSTR lpLibFileNamea; // [esp+0h] [ebp-Ch]
  int v4; // [esp+4h] [ebp-8h]
  HMODULE hModule; // [esp+8h] [ebp-4h]

  result = (HMODULE)a1;
  lpLibFileName = a1;
  v4 = 0;
  while ( *lpLibFileName )
  {
    result = LoadLibraryA(lpLibFileName);
    hModule = result;
    if ( !result )
      break;
    while ( *lpLibFileName )
      ++lpLibFileName;
    for ( lpLibFileNamea = lpLibFileName + 1; ; ++lpLibFileNamea )
    {
      result = (HMODULE)*lpLibFileNamea;
      if ( !*lpLibFileNamea )
        break;
      dword_4186B8[v4++] = (int)GetProcAddress(hModule, lpLibFileNamea);
      while ( *lpLibFileNamea )
        ++lpLibFileNamea;
    }
    while ( *lpLibFileNamea )
      result = (HMODULE)++lpLibFileNamea;
    lpLibFileName = lpLibFileNamea + 1;
  }
  return result;
}

```

## Overview of Windows Command Operations
<a id="delete-shadow"></a>


![image](/images/dharma/dharma-08.png)

C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe" "mode con cp select=1251\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\nExit\n"

![image](/images/dharma/dharma-09.png)

1.  `C:\WINDOWS\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1`: This command appears to be running the "conhost.exe" program with specific arguments. However, "conhost.exe" is a Windows system component that manages the command prompt console. The "0xffffffff" parameter is not a standard option for "conhost.exe," and "-ForceV1" seems to be a custom argument, but without context, it's hard to say exactly what this command does. It could be specific to particular software or a custom script.
    
2.  `mode con cp select=1251`: This command configures the code page of the Windows console to be 1251. The code page is used to handle characters and character encoding in the console. Code page 1251 is typically associated with Cyrillic encoding used for languages like Russian.
    
3.  `vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet`: This command is used to delete all volume shadow copies created by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on a Windows system. Volume shadow copies are typically used for system backups. The "/all" option indicates to delete all volume copies, and "/quiet" specifies to do it silently without prompting the user.

## Encryption files

```cpp
int __cdecl sub_4033B0(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, int a7, int a8, int a9, int a10, int a11)
{
  int v12; // [esp+0h] [ebp-10h]
  int v13; // [esp+4h] [ebp-Ch]
  unsigned __int64 v14; // [esp+8h] [ebp-8h] BYREF

  v12 = 0;
  v13 = CreateFileW_sub_406830(a1, 0x80000000, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0);
  if ( v13 != -1 )
  {
    if ( GetSizeFile_sub_406720(v13, &v14) )
    {
      CloseHandle_sub_406890(v13);
      if ( v14 )
      {
        if ( v14 <= 0x180000 )
          return crypt-small-file_sub_403454(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11);
        else
          return crypt-big-file_sub_40341B(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11);
      }
    }
  }
  return v12;
}
```

The function `sub_4033B0` appears to be designed to select between two encryption methods based on the size of a file. Here's a summary of its operation:

1.  **Initialization**:
    
    -   The function declares local variables to store states and results (`v12`, `v13`, `v14`).
2.  **File Opening**:
    
    -   Opens a file (identified by `a1`) in read mode (`CreateFileW_sub_406830`).
3.  **File Size Checking**:
    
    -   If the file is successfully opened, it retrieves the file's size (`GetSizeFile_sub_406720`).
    -   Closes the file after obtaining its size.
4.  **Encryption Mode Selection**:
    
    -   If the file size (`v14`) is non-zero, it chooses an encryption method based on this size:
        -   If `v14` is less than or equal to `0x180000` (approximately 1.5 MB), it calls `crypt-small-file_sub_403454`, presumably for smaller files.
        -   If `v14` is greater than `0x180000`, it calls `crypt-big-file_sub_40341B`, presumably for larger files.
5.  **Return**:
    
    -   The function returns either the result of `crypt-small-file_sub_403454`, `crypt-big-file_sub_40341B`, or `0` if the file couldn't be opened or its size isn't valid.

In summary, `sub_4033B0` is a routing function that determines the appropriate encryption method to use based on the file size. It interfaces with specialized functions for encrypting files of different sizes.
